Hello, 

Thank you very much for buying this Asset, i'm really hoping that it will suit your needs and help you create awesome games!
If you find any issues, fell free to let me know and i'll try to fix them.

Also, if you have any suggestion or would like to see an specific prop included in the pack, 
you can send me a reference and if it suits the asset pack i'll include it on the next update.

About this Asset: PostApocalyptic Building: Pharmacy01, 
I tried to keep things very organized, so you will find several folders inside, each one referenced to its content:
-ImportedFBX
-Materials
-Prefabs
-Scene
-Textures

I've included 2 scenes, the showcase scene displays every fbx model included in this pack.
The second scene, is a Demo scene where i've put together all the props inside the building.

Future Updates, what to expect?
You can expect more props and LODS.


Keep Making Awesome Games!,
